## Introduction

*WhatsTrapp* is a tool for analyzing and dumping WhatsApp accounts.

## How it works

*WhatsTrapp* uses a *Man In the Middle* (MITM) attack to establish a session with the WhatsApp's target: once the session
has been established, actions for retrieving and collecting the data are executed in the browser context by using the
very same *WhatsApp Web's APIs* (thank to a bit of reverse engineering).

Finally, the collected data are indexed in *Elasticsearch* in order to allow you to search for a specific text and sort
the messages by time.

## Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Installing

Clone the repository:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:Wicker25/whatstrapp.git
$ cd whatstrapp/
```

## Usage

Launch the *WhatsTrapp* server with:
```
$ docker-compose up
```

Then open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8025/ and wait until the QR code has been loaded.

Launch the target's *WhatsApp* and, from the main menu, select "WhatsApp Web".

Finally, take a picture of the QR code and enjoy it!

## Data Analysis

Open *Kibana's Discover* page at http://127.0.0.1:5601/app/kibana#/discover.

You can start a new *Search* or open one of the default ones from the menu on the right.

## Architecture

The *WhatsTrapp*'s architecture consists of a *Puppeteer*, *Puppets*, and *Clients*:

- The *Puppeteer* launches the browser instance by using [Google Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) and injects a *Puppet* into it;
- The *Puppet* is a JavaScript that performs actions in the [WhatsApp Web](https://web.whatsapp.com/) page;
- The *Client* is the user interface used by the attacker for performing the hack.

All of the components communicate with each other via *WebSocket*.

## Caveats

If you are trying to use *WhatsTrapp* on a GNU/Linux operating system you might need to increase the kernel parameter `max_map_count` by running:
```
# sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
```

See the [Elasticsearch Reference](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/vm-max-map-count.html) for more details.

If you are trying to use *WhatsTrapp* on Windows but you get the error `Windows named pipe error: ...` check this discussion: https://github.com/Wicker25/whatstrapp/issues/1.
